Script File Breakdown

Script files have the extension .dsc and consist of 4-byte (32-bit) words. The
first word is some sort of header or unknown data. Everything past that is a
combination of opcodes and parameters. The opcode comes first, followed by the
number of parameters associated to it. An opcode overview is given below.

Script Opcode Details

This is a more detailed look at the functionality and parameters of script
opcodes. This section is incomplete.

0x00 - END
Indicates the end of script execution. No parameters.

0x01 - TIME
Pauses execution until a given timestamp is reached. Parameter 1 is the time
since starting execution to wait until, measured in 10^-5 seconds (100000 is
equal to 1 second).

0x06 - TARGET
Creates a new target/note for the player to hit. Notes timed simultaneously (no
TIME opcode between them) become multi-notes. Parameter 1 is the note type;
known types are listed below. Parameter 2 is the X-coordinate; horizontal
screen space seems to span 0 to 480000. Parameter 3 is the Y-coordinate;
vertical screen space seems to span 0 to 270000. Parameter 4 is the angle the
note flies in from, relative to its coordinates; it spans -180000 to 180000
clockwise, with 0 at the top. Parameter 5 is the distance the note travels while
flying; higher values mean faster travel to reach the destination in the same
time. Parameters 6 and 7 are related to note wobble when flying in.

 Type | Name
------+------
  0   | Triangle
  1   | Circle
  2   | Cross
  3   | Square
  4   | Triangle (held)
  5   | Circle (held)
  6   | Cross (held)
  7   | Square (held)
 12   | Left slider
 13   | Right slider
 15   | Left slider (held)
 16   | Right slider (held)
 18   | Triangle (event)
 19   | Circle (event)
 20   | Cross (event)
 21   | Square (event)

0x18 - LYRIC
Sets a lyric from the song database to be displayed on-screen. Parameter 1 is
the lyric index; an index of 0 means no lyric will be shown. Parameter 2 is
unknown, and seems to always be set to -1.

0x19 - MUSIC_PLAY
Starts playback of the associated music file. No parameters.

0x1C - BAR_TIME_SET
Sets the time between when a target/note is created and when it should be hit.
Older charts tend to use this, while newer ones use TARGET_FLYING_TIME. Unlike
TARGET_FLYING_TIME, this uses a formula instead of a direct value. A value in
milliseconds is calculated as follows: (60 / BPM) * (BPB + 1) * 1000. Parameter
1 is the beats per minute (BPM). Parameter 2 is the beats per bar (BPB).

0x3A - TARGET_FLYING_TIME
Sets the time between when a target/note is created and when it should be hit.
Smaller values mean notes travel faster to reach their destination quicker.
Parameter 1 is the amount of time, measured in milliseconds.


Life Gauge

Based on observation alone, these are values that would make sense for the life
gauge. Its initial value is 127, with a max value of 255. The chart below shows
how much the value is adjusted based on note timing when hit. Wrong notes have
varying adjustments based on timing as well.

 Time | Right | Wrong
------+-------+-------
 Cool |  +2   |  -3
 Fine |  +1   |  -6
 Safe |   0   |  -9
 Sad  | -10   | -15
 Miss | -20   | -20
