While I appreciate anyone who wants to contribute, my goal with this project is to challenge myself and not to review code. I feel guilty rejecting a change that someone spent time on, but I also don't feel great accepting changes that I didn't ask for. For this reason, I've decided to stop accepting pull requests. You're of course still free to do anything with the code that's allowed by the license, but if you submit a pull request it will likely be ignored. I hope this is understandable!
